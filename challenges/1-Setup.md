# Lab 1 - Setup

## Prerequisities

0. You laptop: Win, MacOS or Linux
1. Docker
2. Docker-compose
3. GitHub account, if not yet it's time to create one! ;)

Suggestion --> instead of installing .NET Core locally, I would suggest to just install Docker. We could provide the associated Dockerfiles to build the app and run the unit tests and then having a Docker-compose file to deploy locally.

TIPS: you could use Azure Cloud Shell and provision a Docker-machine ;) (TODO - provide resource here)
